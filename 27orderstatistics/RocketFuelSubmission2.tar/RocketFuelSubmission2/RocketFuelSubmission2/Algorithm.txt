O(log n) time complexity.
O(1) space

We can solve the problem in O(log n) time by noting that the arrays given to us are sorted.The idea is to use an approach similar to 'binary search'. 
After each comparison, we increment the appropriate index by twice its value.

Note: We have to take care of border cases where incrementing the indices (i and j in our code) by twice the value takes us beyond the median_index. In such cases we use a separate variable (k and l in the code) to maintain previous state information. After that we re-initialize the indices and kickstart the increment process again.
